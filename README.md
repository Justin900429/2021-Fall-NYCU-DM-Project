## Introduction
In this project, we're going to measure time using some physics phenomenon. We choose to use [Newton's law of cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling) as the basics to figure out the time.

## Set up the environment
```shell script
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running code
To successfully activate the code, both `clock.py` and `server.py` should be started:
> Note: `clock.py` should be ran first
```shell script
$ python clock.py
$ python sensor.py
``` 

The result would be like
